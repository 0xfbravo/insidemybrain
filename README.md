## Hi there, I'm a mobile developer! 📱
Mainly working with Swift, Kotlin, and Flutter (when I want a multi platform delivery).
Currentl

I've worked with common mobile development APIs and SDKs such as Google Maps API, Google Speech API, Firebase SDK, SQLite, Salesforce among others.
Most times when I'm architecting some project, I use the Clean Architecture as my start point.

Other programming languages, platforms, and things that I've used (but not always):
- 🚨 Javascript
- 🧩 Angular (Typescript)
- 🛸 Node.JS
- 🍃 MongoDB
- ☕️ Coffee
- 🐣 Humor sense

Feel free to contact me for any subject!
