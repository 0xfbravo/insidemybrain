I'm a Brazilian mobile developer that has worked with team management for a while.
Mainly I've worked with Swift, Kotlin, and Flutter (In some cases of clients wanting a multi-platform delivery).
Most times when I'm architecting some projects, I use Clean Architecture as my starting point and I think that you should use it too.

Feel free to contact me!

Thank you for your time! 🧑🏻‍💻☕️
